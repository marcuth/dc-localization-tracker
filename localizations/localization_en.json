Upon releasing Breeding Reborn, Phaun Tower was intended to apply a flat boost to the best possible outcomes when breeding. However, once released, the Tower did not function as intended, resulting in an edge case of receiving Legendaries at a rate unbalanced with the rest of the game. As of March 2nd, the Tower now functions as originally designed, multiplying the weight of the highest rarity outcomes in a pool by 3. \n\nHowever, as some of you invested in the Tower during this time, we wanted to express our apologies for the incident and unclear communication surrounding the changes that were made. We have identified all players who invested in Phaun Tower between the Breeding Reborn release on December 7th and the final rebalance on March 2nd. As one of these players, you will be receiving a gift of 200 Gems and 200 Legendary Joker Orbs which have been applied to your Dragon City account. Thank you for your understanding and as always, thank you for playing!\n\nSincerely,\nThe Dragon City Team", "tid_fi_clashofhouses_name": "TEST OF TERRA", "tid_BP_helpview_description2": "Unlock premium Rewards with the Divine Pass and complete goals to obtain them!
